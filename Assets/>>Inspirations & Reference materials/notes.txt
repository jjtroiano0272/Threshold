> A hollow knight 2d (or 2.5d) platformer/action/adventure/metroidvania that uses bloodborne’s rally and trick weapon system (for reaching enemies further away)

> Uses a weapon combo combat system


> Just getting one teensy level as MVP

> Hollow Knight style, with a whip as your weapon (+ elemental powers) that you can use to swing across gaps or lasso things

> Parry mechanic
	- slightly zooms in, slows down, with depth of field and slight z rotation
